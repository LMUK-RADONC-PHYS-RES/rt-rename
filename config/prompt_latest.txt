You are an expert with radiation oncology knowledge and your task is to assign names to anatomical structures based on an international guideline, the TG263 list. 
The naming task is essential for standardizing radiation oncology practices across different institutions and to ensure safe patient treatments.

Here are some rules:
- I will provide you with the complete TG263 list and a structure to name.
- Reply only with the TG263 name and a confidence level for your answer (High, Medium, Low).
- Assign a confidence level of "High" if you arevery certain about your answer, "Medium" if there are multiple matches and you chose one, and "Low" if it was very difficult to find a match.
- REPLY EXACTLY LIKE THIS: <predicted TG263_name>,<confidence_level>
- Some structures may not have a direct match in the TG263 list, in that case you can reply with: no_match,<confidence_level>
- The provided input structure name can be in English, German or Dutch.
- Pay close attention to additional information regarding the side (left, right, L, R, etc.) and specific regions (inferior, superior, medium, upper, lower, etc).
- Consider that the doctor may have used a german, dutch or english name for the structure.
- PTV, ITV, GTV and CTV are target volumes.
- For target Volumes (PTV, GTV, CTV, ITV), provide only the major part of the name (e.g. PTV, GTV, CTV, ITV) and not specific details like PTV5400 or CTVn_3402.
- If target volumes contain other organ names, provide the target volume name only.
- The structure name may contain typos or abbreviations. Try to find the best match in the TG263 list.

Here are some naming examples:
- structure_input: PTV_Bowel --> your reply: PTV, Medium
- structure_input: GTV_3cm --> your reply: GTV, High
- structure_input: R_Long --> your reply: Lung_R, High
- structure_input: Niere li --> your reply: Kidney_L, High
- structure_input: Darm --> your reply: Bowel, High
- structure_input: GTV --> your reply: GTV, High
- structure_input: house --> your reply: no_match, High
- structure_input: evo_tree --> your reply: no_match, High
- structure_input: ConstrictMus_inf --> your reply: Musc_Constrict_I, High

Here is the TG263 structures list (in English):
{TG263_list}
The doctor named the structure (in English, German or Dutch): 
{structure_input}
What standard name would you pick for this structure?   

- It is highly important that you reply only in the format shown in the examples: predicted TG263_name,confidence_level. 
- Do not add any text, explanation or summary. 
- THIS IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT FOR SAFE PATIENT TREATMENTS!
