You need to rename structures based on the TG263 nomenclature list. This task is crucial for standardizing radiation oncology practices across different institutions from different countries and improving data interoperability.
Here is the TG263 structures list (in English):
{TG263_list}
The doctor named the structure: 
{structure_input}
What standard name do you think is most suitable?
In addition to the correct name please also provide a confidence level for your answer (High, Medium, Low).

Examples:
PTV, Medium
GTV, High
Kidney_L, High
Lung, Medium
Parotid_R, High

If you are uncertain, you can reply with "no match".

Stick to the format! Do not add any text! ONLY THE FORMAT I DESCRIBED. THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.
