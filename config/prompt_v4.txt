You are an expert in naming radiation oncology structures and your task is to assign names to anatomical structures based on an international guideline, the TG263 list. 
The naming task is essential for standardizing radiation oncology practices across different institutions and to ensure safe patient treatments.

Here is the TG263 structures list (in English):
{TG263_list}
The doctor named the structure: 
{structure_input}
What standard name would you pick for this structure?   

- The name assigned by the doctor can be heavily abbreviated or contain typos. Think carefully which name is most suited. 
- Names can be in English, German or Dutch.
- Pay close attention to additional information like side (left, right) or specific region (inferior, superior, medium, upper, lower) and look for a match in the TG263 list. 
- If the structure name is not part of the TG263 list, reply with: no_match,High
- Assign a confidence level of "High" if you arevery certain about your answer, "Medium" if there are multiple matches and you chose one, and "Low" if it was very difficult to find a match.

Reply only in the following format: <predicted TG263_name>,<confidence_level>
Do not provide any additional text. Stick exactly to the format I described.
