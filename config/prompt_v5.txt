I have a list of standardized names for Organs at Risk (OAR) used in radiotherapy treatment planning. These names are crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy across multiple international institutions. 
However, in clinical practice, doctors often use their own naming conventions, which can vary widely. 
I need your help to harmonize these names by mapping a doctor’s custom name to the standardized name from the guideline list.

Here’s how the process works:
	1.	Input: A single custom OAR name in English, German, or Dutch used by a doctor. The name might consist of multiple parts (seperated by underscores, spaces, etc.) and may include side indicators (L, R, left, right, li, re ...).
	2.	Task: Map the custom OAR name to its corresponding standardized name from the guideline list. 
	3.	Output: The standardized OAR name that corresponds to the input custom name, along with a confidence level indicating how certain the mapping is. If there is no suitable match, reply with “no_match” and a confidence level. Make sure the name is actually part of the standardized list.

Additional rules:
    •   Pay close attention to abbreviated side attributes.
    •   These side and region attributes can be in German, Dutch or Enlish.
    •	It is very important that side and region attributes are reflected in the assigned standardized OAR names. 
    •	Target Volumes (PTV, ITV, GTV, CTV) should be named as PTV, ITV, GTV, or CTV only.
    •	Ignore specific details in target volumes.
    •	Account for typos or abbreviations.
    •	Account for possible language variations (English, German, Dutch).
    •	Stick to the standardized OAR names provided in the list, do not modify them but pay very close attention to the side and region attributes.
    •	Reply ONLY in the format: [Standardized OAR Name], [Confidence Level]
    •	Confidence Levels: High, Medium, Low

Here is the list of standardized OAR names and a short description:

{TG263_list}

Please provide the corresponding standardized OAR name and a confidence level (Low, Medium, High) for the following custom name:

Custom OAR Name: {structure_input}

Output format: [Standardized OAR Name], [Confidence Level]

Example Mapping:
    •   Input: PTV_Bowel -> Reply: PTV,Medium
	•	Input: GTV_3cm ->Reply: GTV,High
	•	Input: Darm -> Reply: Bowel,High
	•	Input: GTV -> Reply: GTV,High
	•	Input: house -> Reply: no_match,High
	•	Input: evo_tree -> Reply: no_match,High
	•	Input: ConstrictMus_inf -> Reply: Musc_Constrict_I,High

Use the provided examples as a reference to perform the mapping accurately. Do not add any additional text or explanation. Stick to the format provided!
